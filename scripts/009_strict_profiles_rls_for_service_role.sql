-- This script aims to ensure that the service_role has appropriate access
-- to the profiles table, especially for admin-level operations.

-- In Supabase, the `service_role` key inherently bypasses all Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
-- This means any `supabaseServer` client initialized with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
-- will automatically have full read/write access to all tables, regardless of RLS policies.

-- Therefore, this script is primarily for documentation or if you were to
-- implement more granular control over the service_role's access (e.g., via custom functions
-- with `security invoker` and specific grants, which is an advanced use case).

-- For the current application's needs (server actions using `supabaseServer`),
-- no explicit SQL changes are required here to grant access to the service_role,
-- as its key already provides it.

-- If you wanted to explicitly grant permissions to the 'service_role' *user* (not the key),
-- it would look something like this, but this is usually not necessary for the service_role key:
-- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE public.profiles TO service_role;
-- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO service_role;
-- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO service_role;

-- No changes are applied by this script for the current setup.

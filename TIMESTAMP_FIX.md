# Transaction History Timestamp Fix

## Issue
The transaction history and analytics were using the receipt's `date_time` field (the date from the receipt itself) instead of the system timestamp (`saved_at`) for filtering and display.

## Problem
- **Transaction History**: Was showing receipt dates instead of when receipts were added to the system
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Date filters were based on receipt dates, not system timestamps
- **Export**: CSV export was using receipt dates instead of system timestamps

## Solution
Updated all components to use `saved_at` (system timestamp) instead of `date_time` (receipt date) for:

### 1. Transaction History (`components/transaction-history.tsx`)
- **Date Column**: Now shows "Date Added" using `saved_at`
- **Date Filtering**: Filters based on when receipts were added to system
- **Export**: CSV now includes both "Date Added" and "Receipt Date" columns

### 2. Analytics Dashboard (`components/analytics-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Date Filtering**: All date range filters now use `saved_at`
- **Sales Trend**: Chart data based on when receipts were added
- **Agent Performance**: Calculations based on system timestamps

## Changes Made

### Transaction History
```typescript
// Before: Using receipt date
const txDate = new Date(tx.date_time)

// After: Using system timestamp
const txDate = new Date(tx.saved_at)
```

### Analytics Dashboard
```typescript
// Before: Using receipt date for filtering
const receiptDate = new Date(receipt.date_time)

// After: Using system timestamp for filtering
const receiptDate = new Date(receipt.saved_at)
```

### CSV Export
```typescript
// Before: Only receipt date
["Date", "Reference", ...]

// After: Both system and receipt dates
["Date Added", "Receipt Date", "Reference", ...]
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate History**: Shows when receipts were actually processed
2. **Consistent Filtering**: Date filters work based on system activity
3. **Better Analytics**: Charts reflect actual processing timeline
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear distinction between receipt date and processing date

## Database Fields

- `saved_at`: System timestamp when receipt was added (used for history/filtering)
- `date_time`: Original receipt date from the GCash transaction (for reference)

## User Experience

### Transaction History
- **Date Added**: Shows when the receipt was uploaded to the system
- **Receipt Date**: Available in export for reference
- **Filtering**: "Today", "This Week", "This Month" now based on upload date

### Analytics Dashboard
- **Date Filters**: Based on when receipts were processed
- **Charts**: Reflect actual processing activity
- **Commissions**: Calculated based on processing timeline

## Migration Notes

- **Existing Data**: No database changes needed
- **Backward Compatibility**: Receipt dates still stored in `date_time` field
- **Export**: Now includes both timestamps for complete information

## Testing

1. **Upload Receipt**: Verify "Date Added" shows current timestamp
2. **Filter by Date**: Confirm filters work based on upload date
3. **Export Data**: Check that both timestamps are included
4. **Analytics**: Verify charts reflect processing timeline
